# company-site
A sample company website
This was a formative assessment for our IT103P (Web Programming) course during my 2nd year as a Computer Science student.
We were given the following instructions:

-------

You are tasked to create your own company website. You and your partner should come up with a company that provides a service. (Graphic design, film making, game development, etc.).

- Before a user can comment, they should fill in the Comment textbox, name, and contact number. Once that condition is satisfied, add the comment to the list of comments. (Check out the screenshot I attached)
- For the image of the user, just add a random placeholder image like this: 
The date at which the comment was posted must also be included. 

Tips: 
- For the date, check this out for reference on how to implement it (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_date_methods.asp).
- Don't forget to incorporate all the improvements that I pointed out in the prelim feedback series I discussed. (Folder structure, variable naming, class naming, design patterns)
